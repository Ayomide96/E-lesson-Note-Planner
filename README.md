# E-lesson-Note-Planner
This project aim is to develop a web portal where teachers will be able to upload their lesson plans, and notes, and the students can access it without the need for the teachers to write on the board again.

On GITHUB, you must make a PR to the feature branch. Everyone puts there code in  the feature branch after the team leads feel it is right, it can be merged to the developer branch and if there is no more correction, it will be merged into the Master branch.
Your commit message must follow a consistent pattern:
For a feature: git commit-m "feat: implemented landing page"
For a bug: git commit-m"bug:corrcted typo"
To prevent merge conflict, always pull from develop branch before making a PR.
